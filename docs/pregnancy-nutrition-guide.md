# Pregnancy Nutrition: Week-by-Week Guide

## How Pregnancy Changes Nutrition Needs

Pregnancy increases nutritional demands to support:
- Fetal growth and development
- Placenta development
- Expanded maternal blood volume (+ ~50%)
- Uterine growth
- Amniotic fluid
- Breast tissue development
- Fat stores for lactation

**Key insight**: Most nutrient RDAs are set for the entire pregnancy (or by trimester), not week-by-week. The week number determines the trimester, which determines the nutrient targets.

## Trimester Overview

### Trimester 1 (Weeks 1-13)

**Focus**: Neural tube development, organ formation

**Energy**: No increase needed (nausea may actually reduce intake)

**Critical Nutrients**:
| Nutrient | Why It Matters | Target |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Folate | Neural tube closes weeks 3-4. Deficiency → spina bifida, anencephaly | 600 μg DFE |
| Iodine | Brain development begins | 220 μg |
| Vitamin B12 | Works with folate for DNA synthesis | 2.6 μg |
| Choline | Neural tube development | 450 mg |

**Week-by-Week Highlights**:
- **Week 1-2**: Conception to implantation. Folate status matters before you even know you're pregnant.
- **Week 3-4**: Neural tube forms and closes. CRITICAL folate period.
- **Week 5-8**: Major organs forming. Heart starts beating. Avoid teratogens.
- **Week 9-13**: Organ refinement. Nausea often peaks weeks 8-10.

### Trimester 2 (Weeks 14-27)

**Focus**: Rapid growth, bone development, organ maturation

**Energy**: +340 kcal/day over pre-pregnancy baseline

**Critical Nutrients**:
| Nutrient | Why It Matters | Target |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Protein | Rapid tissue growth | 71 g |
| Calcium | Fetal skeleton developing | 1000 mg (1300 if teen) |
| Iron | Blood volume expansion, fetal stores | 27 mg |
| DHA | Brain/eye development accelerating | 200-300 mg |
| Vitamin D | Calcium absorption | 15 μg (600 IU) |

**Week-by-Week Highlights**:
- **Week 14-16**: Nausea usually subsides. Appetite returns. Catch up on nutrition.
- **Week 18-22**: Anatomy scan. Baby growing rapidly. Most mothers feel movement.
- **Week 24**: Viability threshold. Brain development accelerating.
- **Week 27**: End of T2. Fetus weighs ~2 lbs.

### Trimester 3 (Weeks 28-42)

**Focus**: Maximum brain development, lung maturation, fat accumulation

**Energy**: +452 kcal/day over pre-pregnancy baseline

**Critical Nutrients**:
| Nutrient | Why It Matters | Target |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| DHA | Rapid brain growth (60% of brain is fat) | 200-300 mg |
| Protein | Maximum growth phase | 71 g |
| Iron | Building baby's iron stores for first 6 months of life | 27 mg |
| Fiber | Constipation very common | 28 g |
| Water | Blood volume at maximum | 3.0 L |

**Week-by-Week Highlights**:
- **Week 28-32**: Brain development peaks. Lungs maturing.
- **Week 33-36**: Fat accumulation for temperature regulation. Baby gaining ~0.5 lb/week.
- **Week 37**: Full term. Lungs typically mature.
- **Week 38-40**: Final growth. Baby drops into pelvis.
- **Week 41-42**: Post-dates. Close monitoring.

## Comparison Table: Normal vs Pregnancy

For a woman age 19-30:

| Nutrient | Non-Pregnant | Pregnant | Change |
|----------|--------------|----------|--------|
| Energy (T3) | ~2000 kcal* | ~2450 kcal* | +452 |
| Protein | 46 g | 71 g | +54% |
| Carbohydrate (min) | 130 g | 175 g | +35% |
| Fiber | 25 g | 28 g | +12% |
| Water | 2.7 L | 3.0 L | +11% |
| Folate | 400 μg | 600 μg | +50% |
| Iron | 18 mg | 27 mg | +50% |
| Iodine | 150 μg | 220 μg | +47% |
| Zinc | 8 mg | 11 mg | +38% |
| Vitamin B6 | 1.3 mg | 1.9 mg | +46% |
| Vitamin B12 | 2.4 μg | 2.6 μg | +8% |
| Choline | 425 mg | 450 mg | +6% |
| Calcium | 1000 mg | 1000 mg | 0% |
| Vitamin D | 15 μg | 15 μg | 0% |

*Energy varies by individual. Use the calculator with your actual height/weight/activity.

## Special Considerations

### Teenagers (14-18)
- Higher calcium needs (1300 mg) due to own bone development
- Higher zinc needs (12 mg)
- Lower ULs for some nutrients

### Vegetarians/Vegans
- Monitor B12 (supplementation essential)
- Monitor iron (lower absorption from plant sources)
- Monitor DHA (consider algae oil supplement)
- Monitor zinc and iodine

### Gestational Diabetes
- Work with provider on carbohydrate targets
- Focus on fiber and low-glycemic foods
- Chromium may be relevant

### Anemia
- Iron supplementation typically prescribed
- Vitamin C enhances iron absorption
- Avoid calcium and iron supplements together

### Multiples (Twins+)
- Higher energy needs (+300 kcal/day beyond singleton)
- Higher weight gain targets
- Earlier and more protein/iron focus
